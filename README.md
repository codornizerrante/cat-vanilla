Some experiments and projects I've worked on using Node.js and React to showcase my CV, demonstrating my skills in web development.
These include building dynamic, responsive, and modular components to create an interactive portfolio.
The focus is on showcasing my technical abilities and the ability to work with modern frameworks to deliver user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing web applications.
